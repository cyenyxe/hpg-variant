Debian / Ubuntu
===============

Pre-build
---------
You need a C compiler, the build system SCons and a set of libraries that can be downloaded using apt-get or aptitude.

sudo apt-get install build-essential scons libconfig8-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libgsl0-dev libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev

Build
-----
From the root folder of the application, type 'scons'. This will create 3 binaries in the 'bin' subfolder.

Run
---
If you want to execute HPG Variant (not just build it), you need to run the following command:

sudo apt-get install libconfig8 libcurl4-openssl-dev libgsl0ldbl libxml2 zlib1g

Install
-------
This step is not neccessary to run HPG Variant, but to install it in your system.

Type 'scons debian' to create a file named 'hpg-variant_X.Y-amd64.deb' (with X.Y being the version number) in the root folder of HPG Variant.
Type 'sudo dkpg -i hpg-variant_X.Y-amd64.deb', and don't forget to replace X.Y with the corresponding version number of your package.



Fedora
======

Pre-build
---------
You need a C compiler, the build system SCons and a set of libraries that can be downloaded using yum.

sudo yum install gcc-c++ glibc-devel scons libconfig-devel libcurl-devel gsl-devel libxml2-devel zlib-devel

Build
-----
From the root folder of the application, type 'scons'. This will create 3 binaries in the 'bin' subfolder.

Run
---
If you want to execute HPG Variant (not just build it), you need to run the following command:

sudo yum install libconfig libcurl gsl libxml2 zlib

Install
-------
This step is not neccessary to run HPG Variant, but to install it in your system.

In order to create RPM packages, you must install the rpmbuild tool by running the command 'sudo yum install rpm-build'.

Type 'scons rpm' to create a file named 'hpg-variant_X.Y.fc17.x86_64.rpm' (with X.Y being the version number) in the subfolder 'rpm/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64'.
Type 'sudo rpm -i hpg-variant_X.Y.fc17.x86_64.rpm', and don't forget to replace X.Y with the corresponding version number of your package.
